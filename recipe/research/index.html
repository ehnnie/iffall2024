                    <h2>Recipe</h2>
                    <p>1. In a mixing bowl, soften the butter using a spatula. And then, add and mix the sugar.
                        <br>2. add and mix eggs and vanilla extract into the (1)butter mixture.
                        <br>3. add and mix sifted dry ingredients(cake flour and baking powder) using a spatula.
                        If you see lumps, you can use a whisk for a moment.
                        <br>4. Fill with batter 80% of the mold coated with butter and flour.
                        <br>5. Bake in preheated oven at 175℃ for 12~15min until golden brown.
                        <br>6. Cool completely on the wire rack.
                        <br>7. In a sauce pan, add and mix blueberries and sugar.
                        <br>8. Simmer and constantly stir for 15min on low heat and finish off with lemon juice.
                        <br>9. Completely cool the compote.
                        <br>10. In a large bowl, add heavy cream and sugar and whip until soft peaks form.
                        And then, add greek yogurt and keep whipping until hard.
                        Chill the yogurt cream in the refrigerator before use. 
                        <br>11. Dig a hole in the pound cake to fill the compote using an apple corer. 
                        If you don’t have an apple corer, you can use a long tea spoon like me.
                        <br>12. Fill the compote into pound cake hole and top with yogurt cream.
                        <br>13. Finish off with fresh blueberries and herb. 
                        Chill the cake in the refrigerator for 30min and serve!</p>
