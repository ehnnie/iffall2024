			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>1. My name is Annie Kim, I am a BFA Communication Design major with a minor in Business of the Arts and Art History, and I am a junior.</p>
			<p>2. As a ComDes major, I am unfortunately required to take this class.</p>
			<p>3. I participated in a 2-day video game developoment bootcamp over the summer where I developed my own 2D platformer game on Unity with Visual Studio to code scripts for my game! 
			I have no intention of going into game development, but I <i>do</i> want to go into concept art for video games :)</p>
			<p>4. I hope to learn to be more comfortable with coding and using Visual Studio.</p>
			<p>5. I expect designing for screen to be more technical in terms of havivng to be more intentional with how things appear on various screen sizes.</p>
			<p>6. I think <a href="https://twitch.tv"> twitch.tv</a> exemplifies effective design because it immediately shows relevant content upon visiting the site. 
			Twitch prioritizes streams from the people you follow to what is recommended based on what/who you regularly watch, which is effective in engaging targetted audiences.
			<p>7. In terms of effective communication, I would say <a href="https://x.com"> Twitter</a> does a good job in prioritizing what you see first with the "For you" 
			feed taking up majority of the space, and the trending feed in "What's happening" placed on the side to keep you up to date with what is relavent to your interests.
			<p>8. As for a website that I believe works well, <a href="https://pinterest.com"> Pinterest</a> is a site that I visit almost every day to draw inspiration in my 
			creative works and personal lifestyle.
