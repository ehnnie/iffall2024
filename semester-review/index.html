				<h3>Recipe Page</h3>
				<p>This recipe page is for Blueberry filled mini pound cakes, a delicacy balanced with the freshness of the berries and the sweetness of the cake. My intention with this page was to create a website that can be appreciated for its simplicity and efficiency. </p>

				<h3>Microsite – Creative Director</h3>
				<p>This Pokémon microsite was developed by Joy Ani under my creative direction! The purpose of this page was to facilitate a quick understanding of the Pokéverse by game generations from the very beginning in 1996, to the present. As the creative director, I was able to supervise the site's design and content development. </p>

				<h3>Microsite – Designer/Developer</h3>
				<p>This Tarot Card microsite was developed for Celina Xie under her creative direction! The purpose of this page was dedicated in delivering all things informative of tarot cards, from the history to each cards' meaning. As the designer, I was tasked to design and build the microsite to my creative director's direction in giving the site a traditional, handcrafted appeal. </p>
